## Welcome to the Unofficial _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ Github Pages

If you're unfamiliar with Github Pages, that's okay - in a lot of ways, it's quite like a wikia subdomain, but we use Jekyll and Github for revision control. The unfortunate downside is that you need to make pull requests, but that's pretty simple once you get the hang of it! If you don't know any markdown, [you can start here](markdown.md)!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Keep-Talking-and-Nobody-Explodes/Keep-Talking-and-Nobody-Explodes.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
